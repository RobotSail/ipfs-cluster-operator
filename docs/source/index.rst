IPFS Operator
===================================

**IPFS Operator** is a `Kubernetes Operator <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/>`_
designed to assist with running `IPFS Cluster <https://cluster.ipfs.io>`_

IPFS cluster is used as the storage backend for many important and interesting projects. Some of the community projects
hosted using IPFS cluster are listed `here <https://collab.ipfscluster.io/>`_. The largest known clusters are host to tens of millions of pins and host nearly 1PB of objects.

The IPFS Operator brings this technology to kubernetes. This operator enables kubernetes users to create clusters consisting of hundreds of peers quickly and easily. See :ref:`Getting Started` to begin.
